# ubuntu-vscode
Docker image running vscode

# How to use it?
## Preprequisites:
- Docker
- Git
- [X Windows Server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) (see details below)
- (Optional) [Chocolatey Windows package manager](https://chocolatey.org/)

# X Windows Server on Windows
[VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) looks like a good choice for an X Server on Windows. It is free, maintained, has good ratings, automatable, and easy to install via Chocolatey: `choco install -y vcxsrv`. 

That installed the most recent 64-bit version vcxsrv v1.20.1.4  released in Jan 2019 on my machine.

# Chocolatey Windows Package Manager Installation
`@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"`
